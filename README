HackPad

HackTO app that loads soundcloud clips and lets the user create loops and trigger them live.

In the current state you can't actually play two sound clips at the same time due to a soundcloud HTML5 widget limitation. Porting to the Flash Widget would solve this problem but I ran out of time to do that.
